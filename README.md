🏠 Housing Intelligence – Machine Learning Web Application

A full-stack machine learning web application that analyzes regional housing data to:

- Predict median house value (Regression)
- Classify price category (Low / Medium / High)
- Perform region clustering (KMeans)
- Visualize market positioning via interactive scatter plots

This project was developed as a college-level ML laboratory project integrating machine learning models into a Flask-based web interface.
